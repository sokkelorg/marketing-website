This role description outlines the primary framework for the position of a
Growth Marketer at Sokkel. While the main areas of work are described here,
Sokkel places great emphasis on outcomes and collaboration and expects everyone
to contribute through their defined role within the company.

We believe everyone deserves to do work that matters. Sokkel exists to make that
real for the people who build things. Your job is to make sure they find us.

## The Role

A growth marketer is primarily a marketer who builds pipelines. The work is
still writing copy, running campaigns, and creating content, the difference is
you build for revenue, not for impressions.

Most software teams struggle with disconnection: between engineers and users,
between output and outcomes, between what gets built and what actually helps.
We're building Sokkel to fix that problem for others. That means caring about
what happens after the code ships. It means staying close enough to users that
you understand their frustrations and their context. It means owning not just
the feature, but the outcome it was supposed to create.

## Key Responsibilities

Your job is to understand the buyer before you write, talk to customers and
listen, create and publish early and often. You own whether it converts, not
just that the content was written. You write whatever needs writing, and write
it well and care about the people who read what you make.

- Build and execute demand generation programs that create qualified pipelines.
  Write content that resonates with engineering leaders and developers. Make
  thoughtful trade-offs between brand and performance, employ modern growth
  methodology.
- Own positioning and messaging decisions. Identify channels worth investing in.
  Measure whether what you published actually drove the pipeline.
- Talk to customers. Understand their context and buying journey. Use feedback
  and data to inform what you create next.
- Work closely with teammates across functions, especially product and sales.
  Communicate clearly about what you're building and why. Give and receive
  feedback openly.
- Take responsibility for campaigns from idea through execution, and beyond. Fix
  what doesn't convert. Iterate until the pipeline problem is solved.
- Build relationships in the developer and product community. Represent Sokkel
  at events, meetups, and conferences. Create opportunities for genuine
  connection.

## Qualifications and Skills

**Minimum qualifications:**

- 2 years of experience in B2B marketing, demand generation, or growth roles
- Demonstrated ability to craft compelling positioning and messaging for target
  audiences
- Experience running campaigns across multiple channels (content, paid, email,
  events)
- Fluent in English and Norwegian

**Preferred qualifications:**

- Experience marketing developer tools, integrations, or B2B SaaS products
- Familiarity with the dynamics of software development
- Experience working directly with sales to understand pipeline and deal
  dynamics
- Track record of owning campaigns end-to-end, from hypothesis through
  measurement and iteration
- Experience building community presence through events, meetups, or developer
  relations

We're building something new for customers who expect a lot. It requires
ambiguity, the ability to ship with confidence, skills and aptitude in the areas
of growth and demand generation, and owning the results.
