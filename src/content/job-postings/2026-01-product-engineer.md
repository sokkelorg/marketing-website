The purpose of this role description is to outline the primary framework for the
position of a Product Engineer at Sokkel. While the main areas of work are
described here, Sokkel places great emphasis on outcomes and collaboration and
expects everyone to contribute through their defined role within the company.

We believe everyone deserves to do work that matters. Sokkel exists to make that
real for the people who build things. Your job is to make that real.

## The Role

A product engineer is primarily a software engineer who builds products. The
work is still writing code and shipping features, the difference is focus. You
build for the people who use it, not for the backlog.

Most software teams struggle with disconnection: between engineers and users,
between output and outcomes, between what gets built and what actually helps.
We're building Sokkel to fix that problem for others. We expect product
engineers to embody the solution themselves. That means caring about what
happens after the code ships. It means staying close enough to users that you
understand their frustrations and their context. It means owning not just the
feature, but the outcome it was supposed to create.

## Key Responsibilities

Your job is to understand the problem before you build, talk to users and
listen, build and ship early and often. You own whether it worked, not just
whether it shipped. You write code wherever it's needed, and write it well and
care about the people who use what you make.

- Design, build, and ship features across the full stack. Write code that is
  readable, maintainable, and well tested. Make thoughtful trade-offs between
  speed and quality, employ state of the art methodology.
- Contribute to roadmap and prioritization decisions. Identify problems worth
  solving. Measure whether what you shipped actually helped.
- Talk to users. Understand their context and frustrations. Use feedback and
  usage data to inform what you build next.
- Work closely with teammates across functions. Communicate clearly about what
  you're building and why. Give and receive feedback openly.
- Take responsibility for features from idea through delivery, and beyond. Fix
  what breaks. Iterate until the problem is solved.

## Qualifications and Skills

**Minimum qualifications:**

- Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or equivalent practical
  experience
- 2 years of experience building and shipping software products
- Proficiency in at least one modern programming language (TypeScript, Go,
  Python, or similar)
- Fluent in English, written and spoken

**Preferred qualifications:**

- Experience building developer tools, integrations, or B2B SaaS products
- Familiarity with the software development ecosystem (GitHub, Linear, Jira,
  Slack, or similar)
- Experience working directly with customers to understand requirements and
  gather feedback
- Track record of owning features end-to-end, from problem definition through
  delivery and iteration
- Comfort with ambiguity and fast-moving environments

We're building something new for customers who expect a lot. It requires
ambiguity, the ability to ship with confidence, skills and aptitude in the areas
of product development and owning the results.
