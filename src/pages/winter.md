# Hi StartupLab Winter Party 👋

Thank you for showing interest in Sokkel. We are in building mode, and we're
hiring two people this winter: one
[commercial role](https://sokkel.io/jobs/growth-marketer) and one
[engineer](https://sokkel.io/jobs/product-engineer).

If you're interested in helping in any way or just nerd about how we can improve
building products, reach out!

Note: We are opening for new investments in Q2 2026. Contact simen@sokkel.io for
details!

**We are looking for pilot customers** that are actively experiencing
coordination pain from scaling their engineering organization.

That usually means companies with 15-40+ engineers across multiple teams who are
struggling to maintain visibility and alignment as they grow, but we don't
discriminate.

If this hits home, reach out!
