# Hi StartupLab Winter Party 👋

Thank you for showing interest in Sokkel. We are in building mode, and we're hiring two people
this winter: one [commercial role](https://sokkel.io/jobs/growth-marketer) and [one engineering](https://sokkel.io/jobs/product-engineer).

If you are interested in helping in any way or just nerd about how we can improve building products, please reach out.

Note: We are opening for new investments in Q2 2026. Contact simen@sokkel.io for details!

Please connect with us on LinkedIn:
- [Simen A. W. Olsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simenandre/)
- [Martin Lehmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theneva/)

**We are looking for pilot customers** that are actively experiencing coordination pain from scaling
their engineering organization, companies with 15-40+ engineers across multiple teams who are struggling
to maintain visibility and alignment as they grow.
