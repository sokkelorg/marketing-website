    <h1>
      Your Go-to DevOps <span>Blueprint</span>. So you can focus on building
      great products.
    </h1>

    <p>
      Sokkel is the foundation for smarter, smoother software development.
      Reliable DevOps that lets your team create, ship, and innovate without
      frictionâ€”because infrastructure shouldnâ€™t belong to just one developer,
      but to the whole team.
    </p>

    <p class="intro">
      We believe that DevOps <span
        >(Application Management, Software Delivery Engineering, Agile IT
        Operations, CI/CD Automation, GitOpsâ€”whatever terminology you prefer)</span
      > is in need of a renaissance.

    <p>
      Todayâ€™s landscape is filled with tools that should empower teamsâ€”but too
      often, they introduce friction instead. Designed more for checklists than
      for people, they prioritize complexity over clarity, rigidity over
      adaptability. Availability is an afterthought, pricing feels arbitrary,
      and the experience? Functional at best, but rarely delightful.
    </p>

      alt="looking for door illustration"
    />

    <p>
      Some tools are too simple to be effectiveâ€”lacking the depth teams need to
      build and scale with confidence. Others are overloaded with complexity,
      bloated with redundant features that add more frustration than value.
      Neither truly serves the teams that rely on them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another option? Hire a dedicated DevOps engineer. But in todayâ€™s market,
      theyâ€™re hard to find and even harder to afford. For many teams, that means
      the responsibility falls elsewhereâ€”often on the developer who shows the
      slightest curiosity. For them, itâ€™s a high-stakes, invisible role where
      seamless success is taken for granted, yet failure is instantly felt. Itâ€™s
      the 3 AM pager buzz on a Saturday, the behind-the-scenes scramble, the
      quiet expectation that everything just worksâ€”until it doesnâ€™t.
    </p>

    <p class="statement">
      Sound familiar?<br />
      Yeah, we thought so.
    </p>

    <h2>We believe</h2>
    <p>
      Every team deserves tools that donâ€™t just work, but work for
      themâ€”intuitive, reliable, and built to keep pace with their ambitions. Yet
      too often, theyâ€™re stuck wrestling with complexity, distractions, and
      bottlenecks that slow them down instead of propelling them forward.

    <p>
      Thatâ€™s where we come in. Powered by the Sokkel blueprint and flexible
      building blocks, we strip away the friction, making technical operations
      seamless and effortless. So teams can do what they do bestâ€”create
      fantastic software that delivers real impact. No hurdles, no
      headachesâ€”just a smooth ride to building something great.
