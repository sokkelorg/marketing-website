# Sokkel

> Sokkel is the next-generation product platform for technology teams.

## About Sokkel

Sokkel helps technology companies spend less time on coordination, reporting,
and conflicting features. We integrate with tools teams already use (GitHub,
Jira, Slack, deployment platforms) to automatically categorize features, track
dependencies, and flag blockers.

Unlike general productivity tools, Sokkel follows features through their entire
lifecycle, from planning to production to customer impact. Teams get complete
visibility into what they're building, whether it works, and if it breaks
existing requirements.

It's time to focus on product development, and let Sokkel handle the rest.

## Key Features

- Connect and group work by business initiative, functionality, and technical
  application.
- Make information accessible across team roles with no distractions to
  accelerate collaboration.
- Surface technical dependencies and conflicts before they become blockers.
- Self-documenting product development with minimal manual effort.

## Keywords

- Product development.
- Future of work.
- Software development lifecycle.
- Team collaboration.

## Current Status

Sokkel is in building mode. We're testing the beta platform and onboarding
pilot customers. The company was founded in 2025 and is based in Norway.
